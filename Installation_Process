#  Rust Setup on VS Code

##  Step 1: Install Rust

1. Go to the official Rust installation page: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Download and run the installer (`rustup-init.exe`) for Windows.
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal.
4. After installation, check if Rust is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

   This should print the installed Rust version (e.g., `rustc 1.80.0`).

##  Step 2: Install Cargo (Rust‚Äôs package manager)

* Cargo comes bundled with Rust automatically.
* Verify Cargo installation:

  ```bash
  cargo --version
  ```

---

##  Step 3: Install VS Code

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open VS Code.

---

##  Step 4: Install Rust Extension in VS Code

1. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace** in VS Code (left sidebar).
2. Search for **‚Äúrust-analyzer‚Äù**.
3. Install it ‚Üí This provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error checking.

##  Step 5: Create & Run First Project

1. Open VS Code terminal and create a new project:

   ```bash
   cargo new hello_rust
   ```

   This creates:

   * `src/main.rs` ‚Üí Your Rust code file
   * `Cargo.toml` ‚Üí Project configuration

2. Move into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd hello_rust
   ```

3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

---

 Optional but useful:

* Format code automatically:

  ```bash
  rustfmt src/main.rs
  ```

Hey everyone! Currently learning Rust from scratch.

üîπ What I learned today:

Installed Rust using rustup

Set up my first project with cargo new hello_rust

Wrote a simple Rust program (main.rs)

Compiled and ran it with cargo run

üîπ Key Takeaway: Rust projects are managed with Cargo (kind of like npm for JS or pip for Python). Super smooth once you understand the flow!
