# Rust Learning Journey â€“ Crash Course with Code & Notes

This repository is a curated record of my personal journey learning the Rust programming language.  
It grows chapter by chapter as I explore core Rust concepts, document key theory, and create runnable code examples.  
The goal is to make it useful not only for me, but for anyone starting out with Rust who prefers a **progressive, example-driven** approach.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Build a **solid foundation** in Rust for future protocol-level projects and systems programming.
- Provide **concise explanations** of major concepts alongside working code.
- Evolve this into a **beginner-friendly crash course** with practice questions and exercises.

> *This repo focuses on learning and teaching fundamentals. Advanced, production-grade protocol projects will live in a separate repository later.*

## 3. How to Use This Repository:  1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SheezaAlam/rust-learning-journey.git
   cd rust-learning-journey
````
2. Browse by topic â€“ each lesson includes:

   * **Concise notes** (theory)
   * **Minimal, runnable examples** in `main.rs` or topic-named files
3. Run code:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin ownership
   ```
4. Use the material as a **reference** while reading [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).


## 4. Learning Philosophy

* **Progressive:** cover the language step by step, starting from syntax, moving toward memory safety and ownership.
* **Practical:** every theory concept is paired with **real, compilable code**.
* **Reflective:** commit history shows **incremental growth**â€”each topic represents what Iâ€™ve actually learned.

---

## 5. Roadmap

* Finish **Enums**, **Error Handling**, and **Pattern Matching**
* Add **practice questions** at the end of each chapter
* Document **traits, generics, modules**, and **testing**
* Transition into **async, networking, serialization**, and **cryptography** (next repo)

---

## 6. Contributing & Feedback

This is primarily a **personal learning record**, but suggestions are welcome:

* Open an **issue** for feedback or corrections.
* Submit a **pull request** with improvements to explanations or examples.
