# Rust Learning Journey – Structured Notes & Code

This repository documents my personal journey of learning the Rust programming language, structured step by step with runnable examples, notes, and practice exercises.

It serves both as a personal study log and as a beginner-friendly guide for anyone starting Rust with a progressive, example-driven approach.

---

## Purpose

- Build a strong foundation in Rust for protocol-level and systems programming.  
- Provide concise explanations of concepts alongside runnable `.rs` code.  
- Reinforce learning with progressively harder practice questions.  
- Maintain a structured reference for long-term Rust development.

## Goals

- Develop a clear mental model of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.  
- Gain fluency with Rust syntax and type safety.  
- Explore real-world coding patterns (error handling, CLI, async, tracing).  
- Build reusable references for future protocol development.
- ## How to Use
- 1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/SheezaAlam/rust-learning-journey.git
   cd rust-learning-journey


2. Explore any topic file or folder:

   * `.md` → explanations and notes
   * `.rs` → runnable Rust code examples

3. Try practice exercises under `practice/`.
